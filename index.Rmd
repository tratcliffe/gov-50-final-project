## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the Australian referendum and projected voting results! The referendum proposes to enshrine an Indigenous Voice in parliament, and the vote is a 'yes' or 'no' answer. I am particularly interested in the subset of voters who are Indigenous and also voting no, and whether age/previous political alignment/residence location etc. has any affect on their vote.
